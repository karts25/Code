    <h2> <span> USTA Tennis on Campus Middle States Sectionals - we made it to Nationals!</span> </h2>
    [Author: Chris Park]

    <p> During the weekend of October 18-19, 13 members from the club travelled to picturesque Mercer County Park in New Jersey to represent Carnegie Mellon University in the annual Tennis on Campus Middle States Sectional tournament. Last year, Carnegie Mellon had sent only a 6-member squad and yet managed to finish runner-up in the silver bracket. Boasting a stronger roster this year, CMU was able to send two teams to compete at the tournament, hoping to send at least one team into the gold bracket with a shot at securing one of the four bids to compete at the national tournament in the spring. </p>

<p> The teams were as follows:
Team A – Shiv Wadwani, Chris Park, Karthik Lakshmanan, Katy McKeough, Allie Del Giorno, Becca Kern
Team B – Abhinand Sukumar, Ben Chang, David Yu, Jason Yoon, Tiffany Zhu, Jennifer Jin, Marianna Oliynyk
</p>

<b>Day 1</b>
    <p> In order to make the gold bracket, Team A would have to get past UPenn 2 and St. Joe’s, a school they had cruised past last year, while Team B needed to overcome both Penn State 2, a very formidable team known for both talent and depth, along with Rider University. With both teams playing the tougher of the two opposing teams in their respective first matches, the pressure was on right from the beginning. </p>

    <p>  <img height="250px" src="{%static "images/2014_TOC_sectionals/chris_shiv.jpg"%}" style="float:right;padding-left:10px">
      As one of the first teams playing, Shiv and Chris knew the importance of getting off to a good start and setting the tone for the rest of the matches. However, there was some indication of nerves early on as both teams found themselves serving at deciding point early in the match. On the first, at 1-1, Chris held serve with a serve out wide that set Shiv up for the easy putaway volley. Then, in the very next game, with UPenn serving at the deciding point, Shiv hit a backhand passing shot down the middle. Spurred on by the early advantage, Chris and Shiv proceeded to win the next three games, with a combination of UPenn being coaxed into errors and Shiv producing some brilliant reflex volleys and passing shots. 
Although there was a slight hiccup with Shiv being broken at 6-2, the team immediately broke right back, courtesy of a beautiful touch backhand lob by Chris that caught both opponents at net off-guard. The tenth and final game saw a lot of tense and nervy points as both teams opted for conservative play and long rallies. At match point, Chris calmly sealed the match with a serve out wide that forced the return into the net. “Shiv was on fire,” Chris said after the match. “I set the points up and he finished them. That was probably one of the best sets we’ve played.” 
</p>

    <p> While all this was going on, Allie and Katy were facing battles of their own as they quickly found themselves down 1-6, which saw them fail to convert on five of six deciding points. The team then produced a furious comeback as Katy showed great spirit with brilliant retrievals and putaways and Allie’s topspin-heavy groundstrokes began to find their mark. Although they ended up losing 6-8, the comeback from CMU dented UPenn’s hopes of getting a lead in the overall score. After the match Allie said, “That was the best I’ve ever played. Katy was awesome!” However, both her and Katy also admitted to “being nervous” throughout the match, which contributed to the early deficit. Shiv and Becca then posted identical 8-2 wins in their respective singles matches with some trademark consistent and patient play that wore their opponents down.  The men’s singles match also saw a substitution from UPenn after Shiv went up 4-0, winning the fourth game with a clutch backhand half-volley drop shot winner at deciding point and the opponent was too nervous to continue. The substitution proved useful as UPenn broke back once to bring the score to 5-2 before Shiv overcame his inspired opponent and the increasingly gusty wind with some crucial net play to reel off the final three games. This gave the mixed doubles team a mammoth 15-game cushion to fall back on.

</p>

<p> In the mixed doubles match, Karthik and Katy both failed to find any rhythm in their games, with Karthik missing quite a few volleys and Katy unable to make much impact with her groundstrokes. Additionally, with UPenn coming out on top of most of the volley-to-volley exchanges, there wasn’t much CMU could do.  Although they lost the set 8-2, they held serve in the first game of overtime to love to seal the win over UPenn 33-23, a crucial victory that gave the team a very good opportunity at making the gold bracket for the first time. </p>
 
<p> Meanwhile, over on Courts 11 and 12, Jason and David played the set of their lives to score an upset win over Penn State 2 in doubles 8-5. Facing a team with powerful serves and groundstrokes, CMU knew that they needed to stay alive and at least try to hold serve to keep the score close. Then, with Penn State serving down 5-6, some careless play allowed CMU to steal a break of serve out of nowhere. This proved to be crucial as a final hold capped off a surprise win.
Tiffany and Marianna posted an identical 8-5 win in women’s doubles but Ben went down 8-2 in the men’s singles in an interesting duel. Although he lost the match, Ben acquitted himself well with some consistent play and showed that he could hold his ground reasonably well against better players. Unfortunately, Jason and Marianna were overpowered 8-1 in the doubles, giving Penn State the win.
</p>
 
<p> The second round of matches was much more straightforward. Team A cruised past St. Joe’s 40-6 with everyone playing nearly flawless tennis, especially the mixed doubles pairing of Karthik and Katy who redeemed themselves in style in posting an emphatic 8-0 victory, sending the team to the gold bracket. Meanwhile, Team B domainated Rider 32-11, despite a surprise win for the underdogs in the men’s singles (8-3), thus landing in the silver bracket. </p>
 
<b>Day 2</b>
<p> With the first major hurdle cleared, all the focus shifted to Team A’s first match of the day. With 4 bids open for nationals, CMU understood that this meant that they were one round away from qualifying for the national tournament. Standing in their way was a familiar opposition – UPitt’s B team, a strong but certainly beatable team, as well as possibly CMU’s best shot at making nationals.
Just as before, the nerves were clearly there as both sides understood the magnitude of the situation. The pressure was raised with the announcement that all sets were now up to 6 games instead of 8. At men’s doubles, the reliable pairing of Shiv and Chris struggled in the first game with the wind and some inspired serving from Pitt to lose the first game to 15. However, that turned out to be the only game that Pitt won in the set, as Shiv and Chris then put on a doubles masterclass, dominating on serve and at net to run away with the next 6 games. Not even a double substitution from Pitt could halt their momentum. <p>
<p>  <img height="250px" src="{%static "images/2014_TOC_sectionals/katy_allie.jpg"%}" style="float:left;padding-right:10px"> 
In the women’s doubles, the fighting spirit of Katy and Allie was on full display once again as they produced another comeback, this time from 3-5 down. Pitt had a match point at deciding point in the subsequent game but Allie’s groundstrokes pushed their opponents back (with one even hitting the line!) before Katy closed the point out hit a clutch overhead winner. Although they tied the score at 5-5, they lost the tiebreaker 5-2. Even so, the comeback from CMU in the women’s doubles would once again help save the day. </p>

<p>  Becca went down quietly in singles 6-1, later admitting to feeling nervous and being slightly overwhelmed by the occasion, understandably so. Her consistent play from the baseline was undone by her more consistent opponent who would outlast her in the baseline exchanges or bring her into the net and then pass her. </p>

<p> Meanwhile, in the men’s singles, Shiv went up against an opponent known for his double-fisted unorthodox game. Early on, the swirling wind wreaked havoc on Shiv’s game, eliciting an alarming number of backhand errors as it was difficult to judge the position of the ball on Shiv’s side of the court. In the meantime, his opponent seemed content to merely keep the ball in play or to occasionally draw Shiv in to the net and pass him. This helped him to take a 3-1 lead going into the changeover. However, the momentum then shifted completely as Shiv was now serving with the wind. Urged on by his teammates, Shiv suddenly became untouchable from the baseline as he began hitting fewer errors and more winners. He also started coming to net on his own terms as well as employing more variety in his game with some slice backhands that put his opponent out of position. With the change in tactic, Shiv went on a 5-game tear to seal the win, 6-3, finishing with a forehand volley winner on match point. </p>

<p>  <img height="350px" src="{%static "images/2014_TOC_sectionals/katy_karthik.jpg"%}" style="float:right;padding-left:10px"> This gave Karthik and Katy a 2-game lead going into the crucial mixed doubles match. All eyes were on this match, especially CMU’s, hoping that Karthik and Katy would pick up from where they left off against St. Joe’s the day before. To the delight of the club, Karthik and Katy could hardly put  a foot wrong in taking a quick 4-0 lead over their opponents. Karthik’s baseline game and Katy’s net game were both clicking. In an attempt to the right the ship one last time, Pitt made another substitution, which proved effective as the new pairing got themselves on the board in the very next game. Two more routine holds later and Karthik soon found himself serving what was probably his most important service game of the tournament at 5-2. Although he hit a forehand error on the first point, an ace and some errors gifted by Pitt soon gave CMU three match points. They only needed one as Katy hit a dipping backhand that forced a backhand volley error into the net. An overjoyed club huddled in a celebration on the court as it got what it wanted – a trip to nationals in the spring in only their second year as an organized club. </p>

<p> Although Team A was then dominated by Penn State 1 in the semifinals, 8-30, it did not dampen the mood of the team, who knew that they had already secured a spot in nationals and were up against a team far more experienced, consistent, and powerful than they were. With more exposure to play at this level, expect CMU to arrive at Surprise, AZ a stronger team than they were in the fall. </p>

<p>
<b>Team B Finishes Runner-Up In Silver </b>

 Although playing for glory only, Team B faced a total of three tough teams that required clutch performances from the mixed doubles pairing of Jason Yoon and Mariann Oliynyk to keep the team alive. Against Lehigh, a 6-2 decision from the pair turned a 2-game deficit into a final 2-game margin of victory and against Rowan, a 6-4 win helped CMU edge past Rowan University 24-20. However, the team ran out of steam in the final match of the silver bracket. UPenn 2 ran away with the mixed doubles 6-1 to complete a comeback victory (22-19) that saw them down by 8 games prior to the men’s singles and mixed doubles. </p>

    <h2> <span> USTA Tennis on Campus Middle States Sectionals </span> </h2>
    [Author: Chris Park]
    
    <img height="250px" src="{%static "images/elikarthiklehigh.jpg"%}" style="float:right;padding-left:10px">
    
    <p> For the first time, CMU Club Tennis traveled to Lehigh University last October to participate in the USTA Tennis on Campus tournament. Teams from across the Middle States region gathered for 2 days to compete for a spot in the National tournament in April.</p>
    
    <p>The club got off to a rough start with a difficult match-up with the University of Pittsburgh's A team. Although they were beaten handily 23-17, some inspired tennis, especially from the men, injected some belief in the team that would last throughout the tournament. A particularly unexpected result came in the men's singles where Chris Park came back from 1-4 down to win 6-5(5-2), saving a match point at 5-2, deciding point when a forehand from his opponent just missed the sideline. Coupled with some close losses in the men's and mixed doubles matches, the team acquitted themselves well in their first hurdle.</p>
    
    
    <p>The confidence gained from the close losses was evident in the next two matches, which saw CMU clinch wins over St Joseph’s State University and Villanova B. The match against St Joseph’s State University was dominated by CMU with four of the five matches easily going their way. The only blemish was a narrow loss at men's singles where Karthik Lakshmanan was edged out 6-4 after a series of mid-match momentum shifts. The match against Villanova saw some clutch performances, especially from the women's doubles team of Katy and Allie Del Giorno, who eked out a 6-5(5-3) win and the  mixed doubles team of Eli Zauner and Katy McKeough, who pulled out a decisive win against Villanova, 6-4, giving CMU a marginal victory of 24-22. By the end of Day 1, CMU had finished second in the round robin group with a 2-1 record, placing them in the single-elimination silver bracket for Day 2.</p>
    
    <img width="300px" src="{%static "images/alliekatylehigh.jpg"%}" style="float:left;padding-right:10px">
    
    <p> Day 2 contained three more exhilarating matches. First up was Lehigh B. Split results between the first four events led to a 1 game difference heading into the mixed doubles match with wins for CMU at men's singles (Chris, 6-4) and women's doubles (Allie and Katy, 6-3). Fortunately for the team, a comprehensive 6-2 win by the tried-and-true pairing Katy and Eli sealed the deal. Galvanized by the result, CMU proceeded to dispatch Pitt B in the second match with a 24-17 victory which included a clutch win by Chris (6-5(5-3)) and decisive victories for Karthik and Eli (6-3) and Vera Artamonova (6-1).</p>
    
    <img height="250px" src="{%static "images/chrislehigh.jpg"%}" style="float:right;padding-left:10px">
    
    <p> The final match of the silver bracket saw CMU take on Lehigh A in what proved to be a compelling match-up. At men's singles, Chris went down in an entertaining duel 6-3 in an excellent display of power tennis blended  with subtle variety by both players. At men's doubles, Karthik and Eli lost by the same score in another thriller that featured many tense exchanges with all four players at net. Katy and Allie were bundled out 6-1 in the women's doubles but Vera dropped a 6-0 decision in the women's singles to keep CMU's hopes alive. With only the mixed doubles remaining, all eyes were on Eli and Katy to see whether they could pull out another clutch win. They did their part in claiming a 6-4 victory, which required a World Team Tennis-styled overtime to decide the winner of the entire match. With the score at 19-22, CMU needed three consecutive games and a super tiebreak to steal the victory. Eli and Katy managed to claw their way back to 21-22 before Lehigh made its move in taking the final game with a break of serve and with it, the victory. It marked the end of an exciting match and an amazing weekend for the team.</p>
